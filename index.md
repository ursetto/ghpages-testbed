# Github pages testbed

This is a testbed. Lorum ipsum, etc.

## Notes

### Basic site

For a basic site without Jekyll,

- `.html` files are passed through unchanged.
- A file `/path/to/xyz.md` is available as `/path/to/xyz.html` (and also as `/path/to/xyz`).
- /path/to/xyz will serve /path/to/xyz.html. This is true whether GitHub generated the .html from an .md, or if you uploaded the .html directly.
- Jekyll is still used to generate the site.
